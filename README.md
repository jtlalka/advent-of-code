#### Event information

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) â€“ an annual event in December since 2015. Every year since then, with the first day of December,
a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.
